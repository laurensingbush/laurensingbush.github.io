# Portfolio Website

My personal portolio website is meant for showcasing my projects and providing a way for visitors to contact me with any questions or comments they may have.

I initially wanted to improve my skills in the fundamentals so I decided to build my website with vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I learned a lot throughout the process and gained a better understanding of the pros and cons of frameworks.

In the future, I hope to recreate my site using React as another learning experience.
