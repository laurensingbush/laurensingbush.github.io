# Portfolio Website

My personal portolio website is meant for showcasing my projects and providing a way for visitors to contact me with any questions or comments they may have.

I initially built my website using vanilla JavaScript as this was before I had learned any front-end frameworks. I've decided to keep it this way, apart from refactoring CSS with Sass, since the goal of this website remains simple.

In the future, I may opt into using a framework depending on whether or not I decide to add more features and need to account for scalability.
